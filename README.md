# Sports Discord Bot

### A Discord bot, when given commands, will give live scores for both Football and Basketball.
The code is hosted on repl.it and constantly monitored to keep it alive on UptimeRobot.
The code is written in Python and the Live score is scraped from Sofa Scores.

I used Insomnia to check the api call. An example JSON output has been shown in ExampleJSON.txt

The scraping is only for personal use and for experimentation purposes.
